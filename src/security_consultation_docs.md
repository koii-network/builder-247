# Security Consultation and Review Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for conducting security consultations and reviews across our projects.

## Security Consultation Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Conduct a preliminary review of the project's current security posture
- Identify potential vulnerabilities and risk areas
- Review existing security controls and mechanisms

### 2. Threat Modeling
- Create a detailed threat model for the project
- Identify potential attack vectors
- Assess potential impact of security breaches

### 3. Security Review Checklist
#### Infrastructure
- [ ] Review network architecture
- [ ] Assess firewall and perimeter security
- [ ] Validate access control mechanisms

#### Application Security
- [ ] Code review for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check for common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate input validation and sanitization

#### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Review authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Assess password policies
- [ ] Validate role-based access control (RBAC)

### 4. Vulnerability Assessment
- Conduct comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Perform penetration testing
- Use automated and manual testing techniques

### 5. Reporting
- Generate detailed security assessment report
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Prioritize security improvements
