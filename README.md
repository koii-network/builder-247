# Earn Crypto with AI Agents: Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task (Beta v0)

## Overview

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task** spins up an **AI agent** capable of continuously writing code, **earning you KOII**. Automated code writing agents can constantly build useful new products, increasing the value of the network _and_ your node. Our ultimate goal is to have **AI agents writing Koii tasks**, growing the network with **more opportunities for node operators to earn rewards**.

## Releases

### Beta v0

- This is the **first beta release** of the task.
- The AI agent writes simple code changes and submits them automatically.
- Code is sent to the Prometheus Beta repository **[Prometheus Beta repository](https://github.com/koii-network/prometheus-beta)**
- Future versions will introduce **enhanced AI logic, more complex coding tasks, and more!**

## Task Setup

## How It Works

1. The Koii Node **launches an AI agent** inside a lightweight runtime.
2. The agent reads an active **to-do list** from the repository.
3. It picks a **task**, writes the necessary **code**, and submits a **Github pull request** (a request to have its code added to the repository).
4. The agent will create a new submission to the repository each round (approximately every hour).
5. Koii Nodes **earn rewards** for running the AI agent and contributing code.
