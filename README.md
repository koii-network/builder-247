# Prometheus: AI-Powered Autonomous Task Execution Framework

![Prometheus Framework](prometheus.png)

## 🚀 Project Overview

Prometheus is an advanced, extensible framework designed to enable autonomous AI agents capable of continuous task execution, code generation, and collaborative problem-solving. Built for developers and organizations seeking to leverage AI for intelligent, self-directing workflows.

### Key Concepts
- **Autonomous Execution**: AI-driven agents that can understand, plan, and complete complex tasks
- **Modular Architecture**: Highly extensible design allowing custom workflow implementations
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Support for collaborative task resolution
- **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms for handling merge conflicts and workflow challenges

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip
- GitHub Account
- AI Service API Keys (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koii-network/prometheus-beta.git
cd prometheus-beta
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

### Minimal Example

```python
from prometheus.workflows import BaseWorkflow

class MyTask(BaseWorkflow):
    def execute(self):
        # Define your task logic here
        self.create_todo("Implement feature X")
        self.submit_code_changes()
```

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Workflow Components
- **Workflows**: Predefined task execution strategies
- **Agents**: Intelligent executors of tasks
- **Tools**: Reusable operation implementations
- **Services**: Background and coordinating services

## 🔌 Extension Points

Prometheus is designed to be highly extensible:

1. **Custom Workflows**: Implement `BaseWorkflow` to create unique task strategies
2. **Middleware**: Add pre/post-processing logic to existing workflows
3. **AI Clients**: Integrate new language models and AI services
4. **Tools**: Develop custom operation implementations

Example of extending a workflow:
```python
class EnhancedCodeGenWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
    def pre_execute(self):
        # Add custom pre-processing logic
    
    def post_execute(self):
        # Add custom validation or submission logic
```
