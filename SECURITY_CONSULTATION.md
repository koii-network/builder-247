# Security Consultation and Review Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security consultation and review process for our software development lifecycle.

## 1. Security Assessment Framework

### 1.1 Initial Security Scoping
- Identify project scope and potential security risks
- Determine threat model and attack surface
- Classify data sensitivity and system criticality

### 1.2 Security Review Stages
1. **Pre-Development Security Planning**
   - Review architectural design
   - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
   - Define security requirements

2. **Development Phase Security Checks**
   - Code review for security best practices
   - Static and dynamic security analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

3. **Pre-Deployment Security Assessment**
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Security configuration review

## 2. Key Security Consultation Principles

### 2.1 Risk Assessment Methodology
