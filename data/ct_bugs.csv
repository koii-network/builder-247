bug,acceptance_criteria
Potential Session Security Risk: Session secret is directly pulled from environment variables without validation,"- Implement validation for session secret before using it
- Ensure session secret meets minimum complexity requirements
- Add fallback mechanism if secret is not provided"
Unhandled Error in Database Connection: Current implementation will exit the process if database connection fails,"- Implement graceful error handling for database connection
- Add retry mechanism for database connection
- Provide meaningful error logging without terminating the process"
Potential Authentication Bypass: No explicit check for user verification status in sensitive routes,"- Add middleware to check user verification status before accessing sensitive routes
- Implement role-based access control
- Create clear user verification workflow"
Environment Variable Exposure: Sensitive credentials loaded directly from .env without encryption,"- Implement encryption for sensitive environment variables
- Use secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Add validation and sanitization for environment variables"
CORS Configuration Allows All Origins: Unrestricted CORS policy increases security risks,"- Restrict CORS to specific, trusted origins
- Implement origin validation middleware
- Add additional security headers"
"Error Logging is Inconsistent: Some error scenarios log to console, potentially missing critical errors","- Implement centralized error logging mechanism
- Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems"
"Commented-out Maintenance Mode: Maintenance route is commented out, which could lead to unintended production behavior","- Implement configurable maintenance mode through environment variables
- Create clear documentation for enabling/disabling maintenance mode
- Add logging for maintenance mode activation"
