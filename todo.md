# Implementation Todo List

## Current Sprint: Prompt Logging [TODO-16]

### Acceptance Criteria
- Create `/logs` directory for storing prompt logs
- Add prompt logging to AnthropicClient
- Log format should include:
  - Timestamp
  - Prompt content
  - Response summary
  - Tool usage
- Logs should be git-tracked but log files ignored

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Prompt Logging**
   - Verify log file creation
   - Check log format and content
   - Ensure timestamps are correct

2. **Log Directory Management**
   - Verify `/logs` exists in git
   - Confirm `.gitignore` excludes log files
   - Test log rotation/cleanup

### Implementation Steps
1. Create logs directory structure
2. Update client code for logging
3. Add log file patterns to .gitignore
4. Write tests for logging functionality

## Current Sprint: Log Rotation [TODO-18]

### Acceptance Criteria
- Implement size-based log rotation
  - Maximum file size configurable (default 10MB)
  - Rotate files when size limit reached
  - Keep last N files (configurable, default 5)
- Implement age-based log rotation
  - Maximum age configurable (default 7 days)
  - Rotate files older than limit
  - Maintain timestamp-based naming
- Add rotation configuration options
  - Size threshold
  - Age threshold
  - Number of backups
  - Rotation schedule
- Ensure thread safety during rotation

### Test Cases
1. **Size-based Rotation**
   - Verify rotation at size limit
   - Check backup file naming
   - Test file cleanup
2. **Age-based Rotation**
   - Verify rotation at age limit
   - Test with different timeframes
   - Check cleanup of old files
3. **Configuration**
   - Test different size limits
   - Test different age limits
   - Test backup count limits
4. **Thread Safety**
   - Test concurrent writing
   - Verify no data loss during rotation
   - Check file integrity

### Implementation Steps
1. Add rotation configuration class
2. Implement size-based rotation
3. Implement age-based rotation
4. Add thread safety mechanisms
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

## Completed
- [x] [TODO-15] Agent Integration Testing

- [x] [TODO-14] Linux Testing Infrastructure
  - Added Linux compatibility test suite
  - Created testing directory structure
  - Updated error handling for file permissions
  - Verified functionality on Ubuntu 6.8.0-51-generic
  
- [x] [TODO-1] Update to latest anthropic SDK (0.8.1+)
- [x] [TODO-2] Update model to use claude-3-sonnet-20240229
- [x] [TODO-3] Fix client initialization parameters
- [x] [TODO-4] Update message format for Claude 3.5 API
- [x] [TODO-17] Comprehensive Log Verification âœ“
  - Verified log file creation:
    - Creates unique files with microsecond precision timestamps
    - JSON format is valid and readable
    - Initialization logs contain correct metadata
  - Verified log content:
    - Proper timestamp format with microsecond precision
    - Correct prompt and response recording
    - Tools used tracking working correctly
  - Verified log rotation:
    - Multiple clients create separate files
    - Timestamps are unique between instances
    - No file conflicts observed
  - Verified error logging:
    - Errors properly formatted in JSON
    - Error messages include original exception text
    - Maintains context (prompt that caused error)
  - Verified log preservation:
    - Files persist between test runs
    - .gitkeep maintains logs directory
    - Permissions correct on files

## Next Steps
- [ ] [TODO-5] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] [TODO-6] Optimize performance for large conversations
